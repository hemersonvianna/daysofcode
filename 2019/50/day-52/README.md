# Set

A set is a data structure that can store any number of unique values in any order you so wish. Set’s are different from arrays in the sense that they only allow non-repeated, unique values within them.

The Set is usually used to test whether elements belong to set of values. Rather then only containing elements, Sets are more used to perform operations on multiple values at once with methods such as union, intersect, etc…
